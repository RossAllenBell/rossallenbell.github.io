          <p><strong>Touchonauts</strong> - My first "real" published game in the mobile space. It occurred to me that I hadn't yet seen a game that combined traditional Asteroids-like evasion game with an all-touch based set of controls. The game itself isn't strictly an Asteroids clone, and I'm really pleased with the end result. Also, I was delighted to find out how much fun it was to incorporate multi-touch.</p>

It's a clone of a clone of a clone and not all that interesting.</p>

          <p><strong>Darkfall Gear Optimizer</strong> - The original Darkfall Online (not its successor, Darkfall: Unholy Wars) had a very customizable gear system where you could equip any type of armor, however you were incentivized to gear towards a specific role. Essentially, the heavier your gear (ie: plate armor instead of leather), the more penalties you received to actions like casting spells or firing a bow. Heavier armor would cause you to suffer from <em>encumbrance</em>, and there were specific encumbrance levels you would aim for in a given player role. This tool would allow you to select the absolute best set of armor for your character. This required churning through millions of possible combinations to produce the subset of ideal gear sets. This was possible in about a minute through heavy use of custom hashing functions. The tool is no longer of use, as Darkfall Online was taken down to make way for its successor, but I keep it around as a good example of the type of number crunching achievable in Java.</p>
